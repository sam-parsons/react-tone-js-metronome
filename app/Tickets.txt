- format meters like 6/8, 9/8 accordingly as default template for step sequencer
- step sequence visualization
- hardcode one demonstrated visualization on step-sequencer
- top level sort on index.css
- ?? placeholders for measure squares ?? could help, but probably noticable

Ongoing Experiments:
- styling checkboxes

Known Bugs:
- improve dynamic performance of dimension controls ?? does this still need addressing? - FN
--- noticable when advancing up numBeats continuous, and space remains in pattern
----> This happens because when the bar is dragged, it kicks off whatever its callback is a shit ton of time,
----- and messes up some data and the app is forever messed up. What to do?

- measure visualization only cycles through top row - this problem is intermittent
